This a jQuery plugin that allows you to create a Shuffleboard UI component.

LIMITATIONS
===========
- Rotation will only work if you include 'jquery.transform.js' or
  'jquery.transform.light.js'. You can get the latest version of this file from:
  https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.transform.js
- When shuffling images make sure to specify their height and width to ensure
  that there are no positioning bugs.

SETTINGS
========

The following settings are available for the plugin:

- autoStart (boolean) [Default: true]
  Set to true to make the shuffleboard begin shuffling automatically.

- animateRotation (boolean) [Default: true]
  If 'rotate' is set to true, this will animate the rotation on each shuffle.

- corner (string) [Default: 'nearest']
  This determines which corner of the container the items will be shuffled over.
  (Values: 'nearest', 'topleft', 'topright', 'bottomright', 'bottomleft')

- direction (string) [Default: 'back']
  This sets the direction in which to shuffle (ie. shuffle to the back or front)
  (Values: 'back', 'front')

- easing (string) [Default: 'swing']
  This sets the jQuery easing function to use on animations. See here:
  http://api.jquery.com/animate/#easing

- interval (int) [Default: 1000]
  This sets the interval, in milliseconds, between shuffles.

- maxRotation (int) [Default: 30]
  This is the maxmimum angle of rotation when 'rotate' is set to true.

- randomize (boolean) [Default: true]
  This will scatter the items on creation and shuffle each item to a random
  location within the bounds of the container.

- rotate (boolean) [Default: false]
  Set this to true to use a CSS3 transform to rotate the items.

- speed (int) [Default: 1000]
  This is the time it take for one shuffle to be completed.

- tag (string) [Default 'img']
  This sets the type of child-tag that is shuffled within the container.
