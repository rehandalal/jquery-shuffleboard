This a jQuery plugin that allows you to create a Shuffleboard UI component.

LIMITATIONS
===========
- Rotation will only work if you include 'jquery.transform.js' or
  'jquery.transform.light.js'. You can get the latest version of this file from:
  https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.transform.js
- When shuffling images make sure to specify their height and width to ensure
  that there are no positioning bugs.

USING THE PLUGIN
================
Simply select the element(s) you wish to turn into a shuffleboard and run the
.shuffleboard() function on it. You may optionally pass it settings as in the
following examples:
$('#myShuffleboard').shuffleboard();
$('#myOtherShuffleboard').shuffleboard({ rotate: true });

See below for a full list of settings available.

Alternatively to run specific methods on the plugin use the following:
$('#myShuffleboard').shuffleboard(method, arguments);
eg: $('#myShuffleboard').shuffleboard('stop');

See below for a full list of methods available.

SETTINGS
========

The following settings are available for the plugin:

- autoStart (boolean) [Default: true]
  Set to true to make the shuffleboard begin shuffling automatically.

- animateRotation (boolean) [Default: true]
  If 'rotate' is set to true, this will animate the rotation on each shuffle.

- corner (string) [Default: 'nearest']
  This determines which corner of the container the items will be shuffled over.
  (Values: 'nearest', 'topleft', 'topright', 'bottomright', 'bottomleft')

- direction (string) [Default: 'back']
  This sets the direction in which to shuffle (ie. shuffle to the back or front)
  (Values: 'back', 'front')

- easing (string) [Default: 'swing']
  This sets the jQuery easing function to use on animations. See here:
  http://api.jquery.com/animate/#easing

- interval (int) [Default: 1000]
  This sets the interval, in milliseconds, between shuffles.

- maxRotation (int) [Default: 30]
  This is the maxmimum angle of rotation when 'rotate' is set to true.

- rotate (boolean) [Default: false]
  Set this to true to use a CSS3 transform to rotate the items.

- scatter (boolean) [Default: true]
  This will scatter the items on creation and shuffle each item to a random
  location within the bounds of the container.

- speed (int) [Default: 1000]
  This is the time it take for one shuffle to be completed.

- tag (string) [Default 'img']
  This sets the type of child-tag that is shuffled within the container.

METHODS
=======

- create(options)
  This is the function used to create a new Shuffleboard from an element. It
  accepts an optional 'options' parameter which is an object containing the
  settings as listed above.

- destroy()
  This function destroys an existing Shuffleboard.

- reindex()
  This function assigns the correct z-index to all the items in the the
  shuffleboard.

- scatter()
  This function scatters the items around within the bounds of the shuffleboard.
  It will respect CSS padding values and make sure items do not get placed
  within the padding area (unless rotated).

- shuffle()
  This function shuffles the next item.

- start()
  This function starts the intervallic shuffling on the items.

- stop()
  This function stops the intervallic shuffling of the items.

- toggle()
  This function toggles the intervallic shuffling of the items.
